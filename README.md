# 🧠 PCB Vision

### 🎓 Graduation Project – Faculty of Engineering, Fayoum University  
**Department:** Computer and Systems Engineering

## 📌 Description

**PCB Vision** is a webSite designed to automate the detection of **defects and components** in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). This project was developed as part of our graduation project at the Faculty of Engineering, Fayoum University.

The system leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to analyze uploaded PCB images and extract useful insights such as:
- Identifying defects (e.g., scratches, missing holes, etc.)
- Detecting electronic components (e.g., resistors, ICs)

## 👥 Users & Roles

The platform supports **two main user types**:

### 🔸 Regular Users
- Can register/login to the system.
- Upload PCB images.
- Receive a visual report of components and defects using an integrated AI model.

### 🔸 Company Users (PCB Manufacturing Companies)

This type has three internal roles:

1. **Operator**
   - Uploads PCB images with Serial Number (as text or QR code).
   - Sends data to the system for defect/component detection.
   - Results are sent to the Engineer.

2. **Engineer**
   - Reviews the analysis results.
   - Decides whether the PCB passes quality control or needs repair.

3. **Leader**
   - Oversees all operations.
   - Can **delete** any PCB record from the system.
